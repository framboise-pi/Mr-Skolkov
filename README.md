# Mr-Skolkov
For tele-workers: start time counters attached to work missions. Get how much work time spent for each mission.

## Why, how, what?
Maybe as you, I am a raspberry user aka webserver and more. 
I was in need of this kind of 'application' for my tele-working, as I did not find on the internet what I wanted, I coded it.
It contains a mi french/english syntax as this is how I code for myself XD
> If ever Mr. Skolkov gets stars, I will clean the code and add langage system

## Install notes
- copy all the files on your server
- create a database
- edit the config.php file (/core/config/config.php)
- browse to your directory
- add a new user
